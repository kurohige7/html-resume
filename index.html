    <p>My name is Osagie Francesco Derek Cole and I am web developer learner. <br /> <!--BREAK TAG-->
        I am currently 27 years old, living in London (UK), planning my future moves with my partner.</p>
    <p>Decided to start looking into programming on 22nd December 2024 and I loved it ever since; also trying a career
        change with the flexibility and possibility of working from home.</p>
    <p>There are a lot of tutorials and a lot of informations about programming and beginners like me can get
        overwhealmed and confused about where to start from.</p>
